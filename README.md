# AI Ethics Project: Data Privacy of Vulnerable Populations in Canada 🇨🇦

## Abstarct 🎯
This Project addresses the pressing issue of data security and privacy in Canada, particularly focusing on vulnerable populations such as teenagers and the elderly. By examining legislative frameworks like PIPEDA and provincial privacy laws, it underscores the challenges faced by these groups due to limited technological literacy. The paper emphasizes the importance of clear privacy policies, age-appropriate permissions, and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, it explores ethical considerations surrounding online privacy education and the enforcement of privacy laws to protect minors. By analyzing the topic using various ethical frameworks, including utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and rights-based ethics, the paper advocates for a multifaceted approach to ensure ethical practices in data privacy and security. Ultimately, it calls for continued efforts to enhance regulatory frameworks, advance digital literacy, and foster a culture of ethical responsibility to safeguard the privacy and security of vulnerable populations in the digital age.
